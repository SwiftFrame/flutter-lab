# 🧪 Flutter Lab

A personal lab where I experiment, learn, and build small Flutter projects.  
Each folder is a mini-project — exploring new widgets, layouts, animations, and design patterns.

## 🚀 About

This repository is my **Flutter playground** — a place to:
- 🧱 Practice UI components and layouts  
- ⚙️ Test architecture ideas and state management approaches  
- 🎨 Try design styles, themes, and animations  
- 📚 Document my Flutter learning journey

## 🗂️ Structure

Each subfolder contains:
```
📁 project-name/
 ┣ 📄 lib/          → main source code
 ┣ 📄 pubspec.yaml  → dependencies
 ┗ 📄 README.md     → quick project notes
```

Example:
```
📁 flutter-lab/

 ┣ 📁 hero_page_experiment/
 ┗ 📁 bottom_nav_test/
```
